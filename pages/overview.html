<p>Experimentation and testing are a fundamental part of scientific research. They're also extremely time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone unless properly managed. expLanes is here to take care for you of the management, running and reporting of your experiments, letting you focus on the creative part of the research work.</p>

<h2>Why using explanes ?</h2>

Since it was expressed in its modern form by Roger Bacon in the 13th century, the scientific method has demonstrated time and again its merit, as the process that underpinned all the discoveries and innovations upon which our modern world is built. 

Sadly, modern ways of doing research impose strong pressure on the time and efforts that can be allocated to a project, and important steps of the scientific method are often neglected. We believe that this quest for speed adversely reduces the meaningfulness of the research results that are nowadays published. 

Admittedly, following strictly the scientific method can be tedious and shortcuts might be tempting. explanes is designed to assist you in the most tedious and most error prone steps, and will hopefully help you dedicate more time to the fundamental steps of the scientific method.


<h2>When explanes is most useful ?</h2>

Quickly put, the scientific method can be divided into several steps, each of which may have to be iterated. On the following table, we stated where the explanes framework can be helpful during this iteration process.
